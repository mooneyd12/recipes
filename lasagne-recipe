Ingredients:
 - 2 tbsp olive oil
 - 750g lean beef mince
 - 90g pack prosciutto
 - half quantity of our tomato sauce 
 - 200ml hot beef stock
 - a little grated nutmeg
 - 300g pack fresh lasagne sheets
 - half quantity of our white sauce 
 - 125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips

Directions: 
 1. To make the meat sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the beef in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all 
 	over. Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto, then stir through the meat mixture.

 2.Pour over our basic tomato sauce and stock, add the nutmeg, then season. Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins 
 	until the sauce looks rich.

 3.Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4. Lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm). Spoon one third of the meat sauce into 
 	the dish, then cover with lasagne sheets. Drizzle over about one quarter of our classic white sauce.

 4.Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking 
 	through.

 5.Scatter the mozzarella over the top. Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling 
 	and lightly browned.
